//! Reactor core.
//!
//! Any long running instance of the node application uses an event-dispatch pattern: Events are
//! generated and stored on an event queue, then processed one-by-one. This process happens inside
//! the reactor*, which also exclusively holds the state of the application besides pending events:
//!
//! 1. The reactor pops an event off the event queue (called a [`Scheduler`](type.Scheduler.html)).
//! 2. The event is dispatched by the reactor. Since the reactor holds mutable state, it can grant
//!    any component that processes an event mutable, exclusive access to its state.
//! 3. Once the (synchronous) event processing has completed, the component returns an effect.
//! 4. The reactor spawns a task that executes these effects and eventually schedules another event.
//! 5. meanwhile go to 1.
//!
//! # Reactors
//!
//! There is no single reactor, but rather a reactor for each application type, since it defines
//! which components are used and how they are wired up. The reactor defines the state by being a
//! `struct` of components, their initialization through the
//! [`Reactor::new()`](trait.Reactor.html#tymethod.new) and a method
//! [`Reactor::dispatch_event()`](trait.Reactor.html#tymethod.dispatch_event) to dispatch events to
//! components.
//!
//! With all these set up, a reactor can be executed using a [`Runner`](struct.Runner.html), either
//! in a step-wise manner using [`crank`](struct.Runner.html#method.crank) or indefinitely using
//! [`run`](struct.Runner.html#method.crank).
